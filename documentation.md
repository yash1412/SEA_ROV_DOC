# Tasks
## Task 1
### opencv
1. insatll opencv
   - create virtual environment
   - pip insatll opencv-python
2. run opencv to access camera
### Resources learnt
 1. ***OpenCV*** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. 
 Library has many algorithms. These algorithms can be used for face recognisation,  identify objects, classify human actions in videos etc.
    - **digital images:** Digital images which are recognised by opencv are stored in form of matrix which varies from 0 to 255  base on the intensity.
      Coloured image has 3d matrix and black and white image has 2d matrix.
      There are two types of images like grey scale images and coloured images.
      In coloured images we have three channels which are R for red , G for green ,B for blue and grey scale images have only one channel.<br/>

 2. ***computer vision*** enables the computer to detect itself by its intelligence about the nature of the image
 i.e it can differentiate between the image of the lamp and the human in a single picture.<br/>

 ### steps taken
 1. Install python latest version from [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 2. Than for pip installation, open command prompt and write command **pip install opencv-python** for the pip insatllation.
 3. As opencv-python library is installed and you can import this library for testing, this can be done by going to python and then use command **import cv2**.
 4. For accessing the camera first open the python IDLE for writing a code.
 5. you can write the code from the given link [access camera](https://www.e-consystems.com/blog/camera/how-to-access-cameras-using-opencv-with-python/)
 6. you can now run the program and you will able to access the camera.<br/>
 ***NOTE:*** *make sure about the indentation, the code should be correctly indented otherwise it will show error.*
